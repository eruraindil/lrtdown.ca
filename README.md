# LRTdown

Website to show Ottawa's current LRT Line 1 status. Daily and as-it-happens updates on Twitter (@LRTdown)[https://twitter.com/LRTdown].

This is 90% lighthearted and 10% serious.

System status is determined automatically by parsing the (@OCTranspoLive)[https://twitter.com/OCTranspoLive] Twitter account every 10 minutes and using keywords to decide if tweets indicate an LRT specific system issue.

## Issues

There may be false positives and false negatives, or this may miss an outage completely if OCTranspo doesn't publish a service alert. This is by no means a complete or perfect system.
