# LRTdown

Website to show Ottawa's current LRT Line 1 status. Daily and as-it-happens updates on Twitter [@LRTdown](https://twitter.com/LRTdown).

This is 90% lighthearted and 10% serious.

System status is determined automatically by parsing the [@OCTranspoLive](https://twitter.com/OCTranspoLive) Twitter account every 10 minutes and using keywords to decide if tweets indicate an LRT specific system issue.

## Issues
There may be false positives, false negatives, or completely missed outages if OC Transpo decides not to publish a service alert. This is by no means a complete or perfect system, so tweet at me [@LRTdown](https://twitter.com/LRTdown) if something looks wrong or you just want to join the shenanigans.
